This directory contains patches that can be applied to the core nova application in order to enable
particular features. All of these partches are optional and are not required for the proper 
functioning of the extension.

multi_scheduler.patch
    This patch provides the ability for a default scheduler driver to be used for 
    non-compute/volume related requests. By default this driver will be the ChanceScheduler, but 
    can be changed using the --default_scheduler_driver flag value. Note that without this patch
    the extension will not be able to schedule launch requests when using the multi-scheduler.
